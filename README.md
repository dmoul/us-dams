# A look at US Dams (Draft)

Daniel Moul

Having learned of the existence of the US National Inventory of Dams, I started wondering ...

* How many dams are there? And where are they? 
* Was there a peak dam building period in the USA?
* What do the distributions by purpose, ownership, size, and state look like?
* It seems to be a perennial challenge to adequately fund the ongoing maintenance of civil infrastructure, including roads, bridges and dams. Skimping on dam maintenance could create significant hazards. Are there large dams with high hazard potential and inadequate plans for emergencies?

## Focus

In this report I look at dams in the continental USA, excluding dikes, and levees. In order to put dams into the larger context of US civil infrastructure, I include infrastructure grades, funding and funding gap data published by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Going beyond the dams, I also look at their drainage area, waterways and watersheds, and land roughness around dams. Where I go deeper in a specific state, I typically pick North Carolina, the state where I live.

## Introducting the National Inventory of Dams (NID)

The following is from the [NID mission](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/about-the-nid/mission)

> The National Inventory of Dams (NID) is a congressionally authorized database that documents more than 91,000 dams across the U.S. and its territories. It is maintained and published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in cooperation with the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, the states, territories, and federal agencies .... The National Inventory of Dams (NID) documents all known dams in the U.S. and its territories that meet certain criteria. It is designed to provide a variety of users the ability to search for specific data about dams in the U.S. and serves as a resource to support awareness of dams and actions to prepare for a dam-related emergency.  USACE is responsible for maintaining the NID and works in close collaboration with federal and state dam regulating agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, to obtain accurate and complete information about dams in the database. The database contains information about a dam’s location, type, size, purpose, uses and benefits, last inspection, other structural and geographical information, and much more (there are more than 70 data fields for each dam). The NID is also used to assist federal, state, and local agencies developing dam safety policies ....
